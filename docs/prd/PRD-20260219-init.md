# Pilot project: create a novel web-based task tracker

## Abstract

- Create a novel web-based task tracker as a pilot test.
- Because this is a pilot test, you don’t have to build backend, build only frontend.
- Use react as a framework, and deploy it using github pages. (project name: novel-task-tracker)

## Workflow Guidelines

- Orchestrator: Create and start from Kickoff project, orchestrate agents.
- Coder: Write code in a feature branch, and review with another agent session. I strongly recommend you to write test codes for all action flows. Use npm for this project.
- Research: Investigate other task-trackers that are both for mobile, PC, and webs, and suggest novel features that can be useful but not provided from other services.

## Complete Conditions

- Successfully served by github.io
- Pass all core tests
- Final confirm by Clay
