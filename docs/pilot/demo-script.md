# 5–10 Minute Demo Script (Pilot)

Use this script for a consistent pilot walkthrough.

## 0. Intro (30 sec)
- "This is Novel Task Tracker, a prototype to help you capture tasks and pick what to do now using TEFQ recommendations."

## 1. Quick orientation (1 min)
- Show key areas:
  - task capture/form,
  - list with status and controls,
  - TEFQ **Now Queue** panel.
- Confirm this is a pilot and collect candid workflow feedback.

## 2. Task capture + basic lifecycle (2 min)
1. Create 3 tasks quickly (different titles).
2. Add richer details to at least 2 tasks:
   - estimated duration,
   - energy,
   - optional due date,
   - optional priority/context.
3. Edit one task.
4. Complete one task, then reopen it.
5. Delete one low-value task.

Prompt: "Did this feel faster or slower than your normal method?"

## 3. Search/filter/sort (1–2 min)
1. Search by keyword.
2. Filter by status (open/completed).
3. Change sorting and explain when each sort would be useful.

Prompt: "Can you reliably find the task you need in <10 seconds?"

## 4. TEFQ Now Queue walkthrough (2–3 min)
1. Set constraints:
   - available time (example: 30 min),
   - current energy (example: medium),
   - optional context.
2. Show top recommendations and reason chips.
3. Explain deterministic scoring at a high level:
   - fit by time,
   - fit by energy,
   - urgency from due date,
   - high-priority boost.
4. Demonstrate one edge case:
   - if context has no direct match, fallback suggestions appear.

Prompt: "Do these recommendations match what you would actually do next? Why/why not?"

## 5. Persistence + limitations (1 min)
1. Refresh page and verify tasks persist in same browser.
2. Explain pilot limitations:
   - client-only,
   - localStorage-based,
   - no account/sync.

## 6. Close (30 sec)
- Ask participant to summarize:
  1) most useful part,
  2) biggest friction,
  3) one must-have improvement before broader rollout.
