# Pilot Recruitment Criteria + Outreach Templates

## Purpose
This document defines who to recruit for the Novel Task Tracker pilot and provides reusable outreach templates.

## Ideal participant profiles
Recruit a balanced mix of people who regularly manage personal work queues and can give practical product feedback.

### Primary profiles
1. **Individual contributors with self-managed task load**
   - Examples: designers, engineers, marketers, operations associates, researchers, grad students
   - Common pain points:
     - too many scattered tasks across notes/apps
     - uncertainty about what to do “right now”
     - low follow-through during low-energy windows
   - Device usage:
     - desktop/laptop on weekdays
     - mobile browser at least occasionally

2. **Managers/team leads who juggle planning + execution**
   - Common pain points:
     - context switching and interruptions
     - balancing urgent vs important work
     - choosing realistic tasks for available time/energy
   - Device usage:
     - frequent desktop usage; may triage tasks on mobile

3. **Productivity-tool experimenters**
   - People who have used tools such as Notion, Todoist, Apple Reminders, Google Tasks, TickTick, etc.
   - Valuable for comparative feedback (what feels better/worse and why)

## Inclusion criteria
Participants should meet **all required** and preferably several **preferred** criteria.

### Required
- Age 18+
- Uses a task list/planner at least **3 days per week**
- Has at least **8 active tasks** in a typical week
- Uses a modern browser (Chrome/Safari/Edge/Firefox latest stable)
- Can commit to:
  - one onboarding session (10–15 minutes)
  - 5–7 days of real usage
  - one short feedback session or written feedback

### Preferred
- Uses both desktop and mobile during a normal week
- Has experienced “task paralysis” or difficulty picking next action
- Has switched productivity tools in the last 12 months
- Comfortable sharing workflow feedback (without sensitive task details)

## Exclusion criteria
Exclude participants who are unlikely to provide reliable pilot signal for this stage.

- Cannot commit to the pilot timeline or feedback touchpoints
- Rarely tracks tasks (fewer than ~3 task-planning days/week)
- Requires enterprise features not in pilot scope (accounts, team collaboration, cross-device sync)
- Works in a context where browser-local storage use is disallowed by policy
- Has direct decision authority over this pilot’s success metrics (to reduce bias)

## Suggested cohort mix (first pilot batch)
- Target: **8–12 participants**
- Mix guideline:
  - 4–6 individual contributors
  - 2–3 managers/leads
  - 2–3 heavy productivity-tool users
- Platform/device coverage:
  - at least 2 participants primarily on Safari
  - at least 2 participants who will test mobile browser usage

## Outreach templates

> Replace bracketed placeholders before sending.

### 1) Warm intro template
**Subject:** Quick pilot invite: lightweight task workflow tool

Hi [Name],

I’m helping run a small pilot for **Novel Task Tracker**, a lightweight task app prototype focused on quick capture and choosing the next task based on available time/energy.

Thought of you because [specific reason: e.g., “you’ve experimented with different task systems”]. Would you be open to a short pilot?

What’s involved:
- 10–15 min onboarding
- 5–7 days of normal task usage
- 15–20 min feedback at the end

This is an early prototype (local browser storage, no accounts/sync yet), so we’re mainly learning what helps or frustrates real workflows.

If you’re open, I can send details and schedule options. Totally okay to pass.

Thanks!
[Your Name]

### 2) Cold outreach template
**Subject:** Participant request: 1-week task app pilot (research)

Hi [Name],

I’m reaching out to invite you to a short research pilot for **Novel Task Tracker**, an early task-management prototype.

We’re looking for people who actively manage weekly tasks and can share structured feedback on:
- capture/edit/completion flow
- “what should I do now?” recommendations
- usability across desktop/mobile browser

Pilot commitment:
- onboarding: 10–15 minutes
- usage period: 5–7 days
- feedback: 15–20 minutes (or written form)

Important context: pilot build is client-side only (no account system; data stored locally in browser).

If interested, I can share the participant guide and next steps.

Best,
[Your Name]
[Role / Team]

### 3) Follow-up / reminder template
**Subject:** Friendly follow-up: Novel Task Tracker pilot

Hi [Name],

Quick follow-up in case this got buried — would you be interested in joining the Novel Task Tracker pilot?

It’s a lightweight 1-week test (10–15 min onboarding + short end feedback). We’re currently finalizing this cohort by [date].

If timing isn’t good right now, no worries — a simple “pass” helps us plan.

Thanks again,
[Your Name]
