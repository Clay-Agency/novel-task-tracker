# Pilot Feedback Questions

Use this structured guide right after the demo (or after 2–5 days of use).

## A. Participant context
1. What role are you in, and how do you currently track tasks?
2. What device(s) and browser(s) did you use during pilot?
3. Roughly how many tasks do you manage per day/week?

## B. First-use experience
1. How easy was it to understand the app on first launch? (1–5)
2. Which parts were immediately clear vs confusing?
3. How quickly could you add your first meaningful task?

## C. Core task workflow
1. Was creating/editing/completing/reopening tasks straightforward? (1–5)
2. Which step felt slow or awkward?
3. Did search/filter/sort help you find tasks quickly?

## D. TEFQ Now Queue value
1. How often did TEFQ recommendations feel relevant? (Never / Sometimes / Often)
2. Which signal mattered most for trust: time, energy, due date, priority, context?
3. Did the reason chips make ranking understandable?
4. When recommendations felt off, what was missing?

## E. Reliability and persistence
1. Did your data persist as expected after refresh/reopen?
2. Did you hit any bugs or inconsistent behavior?
3. Any browser/device-specific issues observed?

## F. Pilot limitations fit
1. Is local-only storage acceptable for pilot usage? Why/why not?
2. How critical are accounts and cross-device sync for your real workflow?
3. Any security/privacy concerns with local browser storage?

## G. Adoption signal and next step
1. Would you continue using this weekly in current form? (Yes/No/Maybe)
2. What is the single most important improvement before wider rollout?
3. Any feature you expected but could not find?
